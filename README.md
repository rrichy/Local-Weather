# Local Weather

This local weather project shows the current weather in your area.

The code is written purely in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
It also uses the user's browser's window.navigator to get the location information, which is then used in the API that will get the current weather.

I made all the images show in the project using Adobe Illustrator, and then hardcoded the svg images into the project so that I can animate them individually.
